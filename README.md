# ClusteringandClassification
Analyses the teeth dataset using Hierarchical Clustering to find the relationship between the animals. 
Comparison of four classification models using four different datasets to analyse the predictive capability of different modelâ€™s accuracy and its standard deviation.

The algorithms both in KNIME and are R is running with 20 iterations to accurately calculate a mean accuracy and its standard deviation.
